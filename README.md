Equipment:

- Raspberry Pi 4 (I think any version will work)
- A USB Soundcard (really cheap one. Mine was about Â£1)
- Baofeng UV-5R (Its a fantasic cheap radio!)
- Cables
 - 2.5mm Male Jack to 3.5mm Female Stereo Headphone Earphone Audio Adapter
 - 3.5mm Splitter Stereo Jack Plug Male to Female Y Cable Lead
 - 2 x 3.5mm to 3.5mm 

Connections:

- Radio SP (2.5mm) port > 2.5mm to 3.5mm adapter > 3.5mm Cable to 3.5mm > Soundcard Microphone

- Radio MIC (3.5mm) port > 3.5mm Y splitter - (LEFT) >3.5mm Cable to 3.5mm > Soundcard Speaker

I hope the above makes sence. Speaker on Radio goes to mic on PC. And the LEFT channel goes from the Soundcard to the Mic on the Radio.
