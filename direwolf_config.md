Direwolf Config PDF - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wb2osz/direwolf/master/doc/User-Guide.pdf

Now we can setup Direwolf. First we have a look about our sound card in- and output

To find the devices we can use ```aplay -l``` and ```arecord -l```.

```
aplay -l
```

On your machine this may be different but on my machine the output is:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ aplay -l
**** List of PLAYBACK Hardware Devices ****
card 0: ALSA [bcm2835 ALSA], device 0: bcm2835 ALSA [bcm2835 ALSA]
  Subdevices: 7/7
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
  Subdevice #1: subdevice #1
  Subdevice #2: subdevice #2
  Subdevice #3: subdevice #3
  Subdevice #4: subdevice #4
  Subdevice #5: subdevice #5
  Subdevice #6: subdevice #6
card 0: ALSA [bcm2835 ALSA], device 1: bcm2835 IEC958/HDMI [bcm2835 IEC958/HDMI]
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
card 0: ALSA [bcm2835 ALSA], device 2: bcm2835 IEC958/HDMI1 [bcm2835 IEC958/HDMI1]
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
card 1: Device [USB Audio Device], device 0: USB Audio [USB Audio]
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
```

The section we are intrested in is at the bottom

```
card 1: Device [USB Audio Device], device 0: USB Audio [USB Audio]
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
```

For the record device this is much shorter as the Raspberry Pi does not have a input.

```
arecord -l
```

And again on my machine it is the following. 

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ arecord -l
**** List of CAPTURE Hardware Devices ****
card 1: Device [USB Audio Device], device 0: USB Audio [USB Audio]
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
```

Now we edit the Direwolf config file

```
sudo nano /etc/direwolf.conf
```

Scroll down to the line: #ADEVICE â€“ plughw:1,0 and delete the # from the start of both lines. 

Scroll down to CHANNEL 0 PROPERTIES and replace NOCALL with your callsign, 

Press Ctrl+x, close an save the file.

Now you can start Direwolf.

```
direwolf -t 0 -c /etc/direwolf.conf
```

The output should be like this

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ direwolf -t 0 -c /etc/direwolf.conf 
Dire Wolf version 1.4
Includes optional support for:  gpsd

Reading config file /etc/direwolf.conf
Audio device for both receive and transmit: plughw:1,0  (channel 0)
Channel 0: 1200 baud, AFSK 1200 & 2200 Hz, E+, 44100 sample rate / 3.
Note: PTT not configured for channel 0. (Ignore this if using VOX.)
Ready to accept AGW client application 0 on port 8000 ...
Ready to accept KISS client application on port 8001 ...
Use -p command line option to enable KISS pseudo terminal.
```

After start you see infos from Dirwolf it begins to decode APRS messages.

All stations use a single frequency. On the VHF 2m band - the most commonly used band for APRS - APRS uses 144.800MHz in Europe and 144.390MHz in the USA.
